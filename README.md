Total number of combinations of three consecutive numbers in the grid

Manual calculation

8 combos per list item per direction
8 * 10 = 80 for across

8 * 10 = 80 for vertical

8 * 10 = 80 for diagonal south east

8 * 10 = 80 for diagonal south west

80 + 80 + 80 + 80 = 320

There are 320 possible combinations of 3 consecutive numbers in any direction
